To run the project, execute ./start.sh after giving the file necessary permissions.

The files configorg1.yaml, configorg2.yaml and configorg3.yaml are to be placed under org<1,2,3>/msp/ directory.

This will automatically be done by start.sh and renaming the files to config.yaml.

The sacc folder contains the chaincode that is being installed on the peers and will be copied by start.sh script
to org1/peers/peer1/assets/chaincode.

The script start.sh then calls genesis.sh within the cmd directory to create the necessary genesis block and 
channel configurations. It will then join all the peers to the channel and install the sacc.go chaincode on all 
the peers in the channel.

Then the chaincode will be instantiated and queried. The sample output expected on completion of running the script is "10".
